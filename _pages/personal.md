In my freetime I like to go on walks, make and build things, and watch movies. I keep a super out of date personal [blog](https://paperviewsinks.blogspot.com/) (which is mostly about Origami, and occasionally other things).


Here's a random assortment of things about me so that this page does not look incredibly empty until I figure out what I want to go here.

* In The Mood For Love is my favorite movie. Some other favorites: GATTACA, The Batman, Whisper of the Heart.

* I have a never-ending list of skills that I want to pick up which I usually forget to finish working on. Right now I want to get a lot better at watercolor painting, figure drawing, and I want to start learning an instrument. 
  * I took a class about figure drawing (and other kinds of drawing), and promptly forgot to keep drawing
  * I have been learning the classical guitar for a while now, although I'm not very good.

* I love playing video games with friends but I don't really play much anymore, mostly due to a lack of time and how infrequently games I'm interested in come out.
  * I try keeping a [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TcX_z6oupu5aYUBFgBWS2bE_bhjFeAhX7OYIWSHAY3I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.63y2ve307j80) of all the games I've played in the past few years because sometimes my friends ask.

* I have a terrible memory, so I end up keeping lots of notes so that I won't completely forget everything.
  * I also keep a very long document of recipes but if you want to see it, you'll have to ask me in real life

* I really hate the placement of commas after quotations. I think they should go like this ("word",) and not like this ("word,").
