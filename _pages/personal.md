In my freetime I do a lot of random things. I keep a super out of date personal [blog](https://paperviewsinks.blogspot.com/) (which is mostly about Origami, and occasionally other things). In general I really like going on walks, making/building things, and watching movies.

Here's a random assortment of things I like and very arbitrary opinions I have so that this page does not look incredibly empty until I figure out what I want to go here.

* In The Mood For Love is my favorite movie. I also really like Whisper Of The Heart.

* I have a never-ending list of skills that I want to pick up which I usually forget to finish learning. Right now I want to get a lot better at watercolor painting, figure drawing, and I want to start learning an instrument. I took a class about figure drawing (and other kinds of drawing), and am currently trying to learn how to play (classical) guitar!

* I love playing video games with friends but I don't really play much anymore, mostly due to a lack of time and how infrequently games I'm interested in come out.
  * I try keeping a [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TcX_z6oupu5aYUBFgBWS2bE_bhjFeAhX7OYIWSHAY3I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.63y2ve307j80) of all the games I've played in the past few years because sometimes my friends ask.

* I have a terrible memory for random stuff, so I end up keeping lots of notes (like the list of games I've played above) so that I won't completely forget everything.

* I really hate the placement of commas after quotations in the English language. I think they should go like this ("word",) and not like this ("word,") because the second choice looks incredibly stupid (to me).
  * This isn't too serious but I put this bullet up a long time ago and every once in a while someone tells me they *really* agree with me, so I've left it up.
