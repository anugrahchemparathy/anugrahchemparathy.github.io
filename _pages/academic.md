I'm interested in a mix of machine learning, applied math stuff, and systems programming.

Here are some classes I took while I was an undergrad at MIT:

## Fall 2025
- 6.s894 - Accelerated Computing
    - one of the greatest classes ever made

## Spring 2024
- 6.7800 (6.437) - Inference and Information Theory
    - one of the greatest classes ever made
- Drawing for Designers

## Fall 2023
- 6.106 (6.172) - Performance Software Engineering
    - code go zooooom.

## Spring 2023
- 6.8200 (6.484) - Sensorimotor Learning
- 6.1800 (6.033) - System Design
- 6.8301 (6.819) - Computer Vision
- CMS.300 - Extending the Museum
    - I got to see the original Theseus maze made by claude shannon sitting in the back of the classroom unlabeled (before it eventually got put on display in the MIT museum)


## Fall 2022
- 6.7900 (6.867) - Machine Learning
- 6.s898 - Deep Learning
- 6.191 (6.004) - Computation Structures
    - At the time, I didn't like this class at all because I didn't see the point. Now several years later I wish I had spent more time thinking about it
- CMS.300 - (Video)Game Studies
    - I love to discuss game design, but I didn't like how this class was designed at all


## Spring 2022
- 6.031 - Software Construction
- 18.650 - Statistics
- 21L.011 - Film Studies
- 6.850 - Geometric Computing

## Fall 2021
- 18.404 - Theory of Computation
- 6.864 - Natural Language Processing
    - heard this field has changed a lot since
- 6.215 - Optimization Methods
- 18.600 - Probability and Random Variables
    - before I took 18.600 I had absolutely zero understanding of probability. It's funny to think how far I've come since then
