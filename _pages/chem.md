In high school, I participated in quite a few chemistry competitions and went to the International Chemistry Olympiad. In 2021 I was an [alumni] mentor for the USA team as well.

I originally created this website to equally and freely distribute all the interesting problems I had found/translated/wrote when I was in high school because I was frustrated by how learning materials were shared only among people within a few random high schools (and everyone else had no idea that all these random resources existed). For personal use, you are free to use these resources as you wish. Otherwise, please send me an email.



### General Chemistry Resources

* [Advice for Post USNCO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyZQdbKZoldMeD61Rrr7Q3HNwMUTs0XutyiODsY_zZk/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Here's some advice if you are starting to feel like USNCO questions are becoming repetitive/too easy. It's not applicable to beginners.
* Join the USA Chemistry Olympiads Discord Server! The link is on their [website](https://chem.isodn.org/).
  * The server hosts many competitions every year including a Mock USNCO, Mock IChO, and several other original format competitions like CODS-CT and ACOT.
* Edward Jin's [website](http://www.mit.edu/~ehjin/chem.html) is another excellent resource! Unfortunately it's no longer online now that Edward has graudated. Maybe you could try the wayback machine.
* [How to Draw Organic Schemes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WoBLcxdby1i8O45ySHayvTTnIZUQPakcO_SS6lY9Em4/edit)
  * An introduction to tools like MarvinSketch and Draw.io which you can use to draw your own organic puzzles (and get a degree in graphic design!)
